###i3 wm config###
This is latest i3wm configuration file for my thinkpad.

##Config files##
- `config` is general i3 config and should be linked to  ~/.i3/config
- `i3blocks.conf` should be linked to ~/.i3blocks.conf and used if i3blocks is used as status_command
- `i3status.conf` should be linked to ~/.i3status.conf used if i3status is used as status_command

##Makefile##
- `make i3` to link `.i3/config`
- `make i3status` to link .i3status.conf`
- `make i3blocks` to link .i3blocks.conf`
